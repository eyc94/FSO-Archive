# Adding Styles to React App
- Look at how we can add styles to a React application.
- Several ways of doing so, but we look at one method.
- First, we add CSS to our app the old-school way: in a single file without using the CSS preprocessor.
- Add `index.css` file under the `src` directory.
- Add to application by importing it in the `index.js` file.
```javascript
import './index.css'
```
