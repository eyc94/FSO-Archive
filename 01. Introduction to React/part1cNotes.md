# Component State, Event Handlers
- Go back to React part1 and use new example:
```javascript
const Hello = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>
                Hello {props.name}, you are {props.age} years old
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}

const App = () => {
    const name = 'Peter'
    const age = 10

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Greetings</h1>
            <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
            <Hello name={name} age={age} />
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Component Helper Functions
- Expand Hello component to guess year of birth of person greeted:
```javascript
const Hello = (props) => {
    const bornYear = () => {
        const yearNow = new Date().getFullYear()
        return yearNow - props.age
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <p>
                Hello {props.name}, you are {props.age} years old
            </p>
            <p>So you were probably born in {bornYear()}</p>
        </div>
    )
}
```
- Directly access props passed to Hello component.
- We are basically defining functions within functions.
    - Defined helper function inside another function that defines behavior of our component.
